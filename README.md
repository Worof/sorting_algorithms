# Sorting Algorithms Project

## Description

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms. The goal of this project is to understand and apply sorting algorithms in the C programming language, following specific coding standards and guidelines.

### Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort

## Files in the Repository

- `0-bubble_sort.c`: Implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- `0-O`: File containing the time complexities of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- `sort.h`: Header file with all the function prototypes and data structure definitions.
- `1-insertion_sort_list.c'
- `1-O`
- `2-selection_sort.c`
- `2-O`
- `3-quick_sort.c`

## Compilation

All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.

To compile an algorithm, use:
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 [file_name].c -o [output_name]

## Usage

Each sorting algorithm can be tested with the following steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_link]`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd sorting_algorithms`
3. Compile the files (as shown above)
4. Run the compiled program: `./[output_name]`

## Coding Style

All C files are written in Betty coding style. For more information, see [Betty coding style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty).
